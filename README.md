# small-zombie-pygame
a top-down zombie shooter in pygame, made for my highschool final project when i was 16. I am now revisiting it, adding some small features and quality changes.

at night, zombies will attack.
during the day, you get some time to collect coins and buy upgrades in the shop

W A S D  -  to move

E  -  open shop, or use medkits

R  -  reload

1, 2, 3  -  switch between unlocked weapons

F  -  toggle showing the hitboxes

(mouse)  -  aim and shoot, interact with the shop
